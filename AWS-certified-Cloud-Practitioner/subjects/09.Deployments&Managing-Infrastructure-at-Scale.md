# **Cloud Formation**

1. Cloud Formation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).
2. For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say :

   ```
       I want a security group.
       I want two EC2 instances using this security group.
       I want an S3 bucket.
       I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines.
   ```

3. Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify.

# **Benefits of AWS CloudFormation(1/2)**

//NOTE: with CloudFormation it's super easy to create and delete resources, which is one of the biggest cloud principle.

1. Infrastructure as code.

   ```
       1. No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control.
       2. Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code.
   ```

2. Cost :

   ```
       1. Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you easily see how much a stack costs you.
       2. You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template.
       3. Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM, safely.
   ```

# **Benefits of AWS CloudFormation (2/2)**

1. Productivity

   ```
      1. Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly.
      2. Automated generation of Diagram for your templates !
      3. Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
   ```

2. Don't re-invent the wheel

   ```
       1. Leverage existing templates on the web!
       2. Leverage the documentation.
   ```

3. Supports(almost) all AWS resources:

   ```
       1. You can use "Custom resources" for resources that are not supported.
   ```

# **CloudFormation Stack Designer**

# **CloudFormation Hands On**

1. Create Stack
2. Provide a stack, template ====> template is ready.
3. Upload a template file

NOTE: This template is actually going to be used to create an EC2 Instance, So this is why CloudFormation is called Infrastructure Code.
