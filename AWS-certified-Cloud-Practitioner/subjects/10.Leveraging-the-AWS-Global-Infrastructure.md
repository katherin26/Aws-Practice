# **WHY MAKE A GLOBAL APPLICATION?**

1.  A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies.
2.  On AWS: this could be Regions and / or Edge Locations.
3.  Decreased Latency.

            - Latency is the time it takes for a network packet to reach a server.
            - It takes time for a packet from Asia to reach the US.
            - Deploy your applications closer to your users to decrease latency, better experience.

4.  Disaster Recovery (DR):

            - If an AWS region goes down (earthquake, storms, power, shutdown, politics).
            - You can fail-over to another region and have your applcation still working.
            - A DR plan is important to increase the availability of your application.

5.  Attack Protection: Distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack.

## **GLOBAL AWS INFRASTRUCTURE**

1. Regions : For deploying applications and infrastructure.
2. Availability Zones: Made of multiple data centers.
3. Edge Locations(points of presence): for content delivery as close as possible to users.

# **GLOBAL APPLICATIONS IN AWS**

1.  Global DNS: Route 53

        - Great to route users to the closest deployment with least latency.
        - Great for disaster recovery strategies.

2.  Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront.

        - Replicate part of your application to AWS Edge Locations - decrease latency.
        - Cache commn requests - improved user experience and decreased latency.

3.  S3 Transfer Acceleration :

        - Accelerate global uploads & downloads into Amazon S3.

4.  AWS Global Accelerator:

        - Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network.

# **ROUTE 53 OVERVIEW**

1. Route53 is a Managed DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM).
2. DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs.

3. In AWS, the most common records are :

# **Route 53 Routing Policies**

IMPORTANT:

1. **Simple Routing Policy**, which has **no Health checks**.
   So our Web browser will go into our DNS system, does a DNS query and gets an IPv4 for example as a result, that's a simple routing policy.

2. **Weighted Routing Policy**, Allows to distribute the traffic across multiple institute instances. In the image we need to assign weights to our institute instances, for example 70,20,and 10.
   And then our DNS we'll make sure that our clients have 70% of the traffic onto the first one. 20% of the traffic onto the second one and 10% of the traffic on to the third one.

This is effectively some kind of load balancing, So in this Weighted Routing Policy,
**We can use health checks**.

3. **Latency Routing Policy**, In the image we are displaying our application globally, one in California and the other one in Australia. And our users are all around the world, The Latency Routing Policy we'll look at where the user is located and if they're located close to our Kelly American Institute Instance, then they will be redirected to talk to that server.

And if they're close to Australia, then they will be redirected to talk to the Australia server.

And this is based on the latency, So in this example, Route 53 will be used to minimize the latency betweeen the users and the servers by making the users connect to the server.

That is the closest to them.

4. **FAILOVER ROUTING POLICY**, Disaster Recovery, we have a client and we have a primary institute instance and Failover one, and so our DNS system will do a Health check ON the primary.

And in case the primary instance fails, then we will be redirected to the failovers.
this help with disaster recovery.

So the clients will know exactly thanks to Route 53, which instance to connect to based on the health of that instance.

# **CLOUDFRONT**

1. Content Delivery Network(CDN).
2. Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge.
3. Improves users experience.
4. 216 Point of presence globally (edge locations).
5. DDoS Protection (because worldwide), integration with shield, AWS Web Application Firewall.

## **CLOUDFRONT ORIGINS**

1.  S3 Bucket

        - For distributing files and caching them at the edge.
        - Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI).
        - CloudFront can be used as an ingress(to upload files to S3).

2.  Custom Origin (HTTP):

        - Application Load Balancer.
        - EC2 Instance.
        - S3 website(must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website).
        - Any HTTP backend you want.

## **CLOUDFRONT VS S3 CROSS REGION REPLICATION**

1.  CloudFront:

        - Global Edge network
        - Files are cached for a TTL(maybe a day).
        - Great for static content that must be available everywhere.

2.  S3 CROSS REGION REPLICATION:

        - Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen.
        - Files are updated in near real-time.
        - Read only.
        - Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions.

# **CLOUD INTEGRATIONS**

1. A company using Apache ActiveMQ is migrating to the cloud. Which AWS service can it use to easily set up and operate its message brokers in the cloud?

- SQS
- SNS
- MQ
- Kinesis ===> Correct One.

        NOTE: Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud.

2. Which service is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that makes it easy to set up, operate and send notifications from the cloud, using a push based system?

- Simple Notification Service (SNS). ===> Correct One

        NOTE: Amazon simple notification service (SNS) us a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. It uses a push-based system.

- Simple Queue Service (SQS).
- Auto Scaling Groups (ASG).

3. You can use Kinesis to perform real-time analysis from video streams.

- True ===> Correct One.

        NOTE: Amazon Kinesis Makes it easy to collect, process and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information. Kinesis offers four services : Data Firehose, Data Analytics, Data Streams, Video Streams.

- False

4. Which principle is mainly applied when using Amazon SQS or Amazon SNS?

- Scalability
- Automation
- Decouple your applications ===> Correct One.

        NOTE: When using SQS or SNS, you apply the "decouple your applications" principle. This measn that IT systems should be designed in a wayt that reduces interdependencies a change or a faiure in one component should not cascade to other components.

5. Which service allows you to send, store, and receive messages between software componets at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available, using a pull-based system?

- Simple Notification Service(SNS)
- Simple Queue Service (SQS) ===> Correct One

        NOTE: Amazon simple Queue Service(SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. It uses a pull based system.

- Auto Scaling Groups(ASG)
