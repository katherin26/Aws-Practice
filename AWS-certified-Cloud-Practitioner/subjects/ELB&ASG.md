# **ELASTIC LOAD BALANCING & AUTO SCALING GROUPS SECTION**

**SCALABILITY & HIGH AVAILABILITY**

1. Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting.
2. There are two kids of scalability :

   - Vertical Scalability.
   - Horizontal Scalability (= Elasticity).

3. Scalability is linked but different to High Availability.

4. Let's deep dive into the distinction, using a call center as an example.
