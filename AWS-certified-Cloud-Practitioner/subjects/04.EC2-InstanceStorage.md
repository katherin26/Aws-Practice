# **EBS OVERVIEW**

**What's an EBS Volume?**

1. An EBS (ELASTIC BLOCK STORE) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run.
2. It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination.
3. They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP Level).
4. THey are bound to a specific availability zone.
5. Analogy: Think of them as a "network USB stick"
6. Free tier : 30 GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month.

NOTE: CCP- Certified CLoud Practitioner one EVS can be only mounted to one EC2 instance associate level (Soluctions architect developer, sysOps) : "multi attach" feature for some EBS.

7. It's a network drive (i.e not a physical drive)

   - It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency.
   - It can be detached from a EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly.

8. It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ).

   - An EBS Volume in US-EAST-l a cannot be attached to us-east-lb
   - To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it.

9. Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS).
   -You get billed for all the provisioned capacity.
   -You can increase the capacity of the dribe over time.

# **EBS - DELETE ON TERMINATION ATTRIBUTE**

IMPORTANT: When we create EBS Volumes through EC2 intances, there is this thing called a Deletes on Termination attribute.

When we create an EBS in the console, WHen we create a EC2 instance there the second last column called **delete on termination**
and by default, it is ticked for the Root Volume and not ticked for a new EBS Volume.
So this controls the EBS behavior, when an EC2 instance is being terminated.
So by default, as we can see, the root EBS Volume is deleted alognside the instance being terminated.
And the default any other attached EBS Volume is not deleted.
Because it's disabled by default.
This can be controlled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
If you want to preserve the root volume, when an isntance is terminated, for example, to save some data then you can disable delete on termination.
