# **DOCKER VS VIRTUAL MACHINES**

1. Docker is "sort of" a virtualization technology, but not exactly.
2. Resources are shared with the host => many containers on one server.

# **ECS**

1. **ECS** = ELASTIC CONTAINER SERVICE.
2. **Launch Docker** containers on AWS.
3. You must provision & maintain the infrastructure(the EC2 instances).
4. AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers.
5. Has integrations with the Application Load Balancer.

# **FARGATE**

1. Launch Docker Containers on AWS.
2. You do not provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances to manage) - simpler!!
3. Serverless offering.
4. AWS just runs containers for your based on the CPU / RAM YOU NEED!

# **ECR**

1. **Elastic Container Registry**
2. Private Docker Registry on AWS.
3. This is where you store your Docker images so they can be run by ECS or Fargate.

# **SERVERLESS CONCEPT**

1.  Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore.
2.  They just deploy code.
3.  They just deploy functions!!.
4.  Initially serverless was equal to FaaS (Function as a Service).
5.  Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed. "databases, messaging, storage, etc."
6.  Serverless does not mean there are no servers...
    it means you just don't **manage / provision / see them.**

    NOTE: AMAZON S3

             Amazon S3 can scale infinitely, there was no servers, it was just uploaded file, and that was it.

    NOTE: DYNAMODB

             We created a table, but we didn't provision a server for that table.
             and that server was, that table could auto scale, based on the load it was receiving.

    NOTE: FARGATE:

            Was to run Docker containers, and as I said with ECS, you create EC2 instances to run the Docker containers so that would not be serverless,
            but with Fargate you just send the Docker containers And Fargate will automatically find a way for it to be run.

    NOTE: LAMBDA:

            Allows you to run functions in the cloud.

# **AWS LAMBDA**

**AMAZON EC2**

1. Virtual Servers in the Cloud.
2. Limited by RAM and CPU.
3. COntinuously running.
4. Scalling means intervention to add / remove servers.

**AMAZON LAMBDA**

1. Virtual functions - no servers to manage !.
2. Limited by time - short executions.
3. Run on-demand.
4. Scalling is automated.

## **BENEFITS**

1.  Easy Pricing :
    Pay per request and compute time.
    Free tier of 1.000.000 AWS Lambda request and 400.000 GBs of compute time.
    Inetgrated with the whole AWS suite of services.
    NOTE: Event-Driven: Functions get invoked by AWS when needed.
    Integrated with many programming languages.
    Easy monitoring through AWS CLoudWatch.
    Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM)
    Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!!

## **LAMBDA CONTAINER IMAGE**

1. The container image must implement the Lambda Runtime API.
2. ECS/ Fargate is preferred for running arbitrary Docker Images.

# **AMAZON API GATEWAY**

1.  Example : building a serverless API.

CLIENT ====> REST API ====> API GATEWAY ===> PROXY REQUESTS ===> LAMBDA ===> CRUD ===> DYNAMODB.

1. Easily create, publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs.
2. Serverless and scalable.
3. Supports RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs.
4. Support for security, user authentication, API throttling, API keys, monitoring.

# **BATCH**

1. Managed batch processing at any scale.
2. Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch job on AWS.
3. A "batch" job is a job with a start and an end (opposed to continuous).
4. Batch will dunamically launch EC2 instances or spot instances.
5. AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute / memory.
6. You submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS Batch does the rest!
7. Batch jobs are defined as DOCKER IMAGES and run on ECS.
8. Helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure.

```
AMAZON S3 ===> TRIGGER ===> AWS BATCH ===> INSERT PROCESSED OBJECT ===> AMAZON S3.

                                ECS INSTANCE       ECS
                                SPOT INSTANCE
```

## **BATCH VS LAMBDA**

1.  Lambda

        1. Time Limit.
        2. Limited Runtimes.
        3. Limited Temporary Disk Space.
        4. Serverless.

2.  Batch

        1. No Time Limit.
        2. Any runtime as long as it's packaged as a Docker Image.
        3. Rely on EBS / intance store for disk space.
        4. Relies (on EC2 can be managed by AWS)
