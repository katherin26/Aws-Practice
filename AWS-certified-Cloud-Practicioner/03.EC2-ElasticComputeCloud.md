# **EC2 SECTION**

1. **EC2** is one of the most popular of AWS's offering.
2. **EC2** = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service.
3. It mainly consist in the capability of :

   - Renting Virtual Machines (EC2)
   - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
   - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
   - Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

4. Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works.

# **EC2 sizing & configuration options**

1. Operating System (OS) : Linux, Windows or Mac OS.
2. How much compute power & core (CPU).
3. How much random-access memory (RAM)
4. How much storage space :
   - Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
   - Hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
5. Network card: Speed of the card, Public IP address.
6. Firewall rules : Security group
7. Bootstrap script (configure at first launch) : EC2 User Data

# **EC2 User Data**

1. It is posible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User Data script.
2. bootstrapping meas launching commands when a machine starts.
3. That script is only run once at the instance first start.
4. EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks suchs as:

   - Installing Updates.
   - Installing Software.
   - Downloading common files from the internet.
   - Anything you can think of.

5. The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user.

NOTE: t2.micro is part of the AWS free tier (up to 750 hours per month)

# **HANDS - ON: LAUNCHING AN EC2 INSTANCE RUNNING LINUX**

NOTE:

1.  Instances => Launch Instances.

    Step 1 : Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

         - Quick Start
         - My AMIs
         - AWS MarketPlace
         - Community AMIs

    Step 1.1 : Choose Quick Start.

         - Amazon Linux (Free tier elegible). ==>  (Select)

    Step 2 : Choose an Instance Type.

         - Select : t2 t2.micro 1 1 EBS only - Low to Moderate Yes.

    Step 3 : Configure Instance Details.

         - Modified only = User data
         - This EC2 user data is a script that will be launched during the very and only first boot of  the isntance.
         - Paste the script :

            yum update -y
            yum install -y httpd
            systemctl start httpd
            systemctl enable httpd
            echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostoma -f)</h1>">
            /var/www/html/index.html

    Step 4 : Add Storage = how much data's disk is going to be available on our EC2 instance.

         - Default parameters.

    Step 5 : Add Tags

         -Name My first Instance

    Step 6 : Configure Security Group

         - Create a new security group.
         - Add Rule :

                - HTTP TCP 80 0.0.0.0/0,::/0

    LAUNCH , Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair (Type RSA)

        - Download key pair file and save it.

    Go to instances :

        - My First | Instance | Instance ID | Instace State | Instance Type | Status check.
