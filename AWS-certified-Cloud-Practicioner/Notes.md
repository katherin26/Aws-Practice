# **WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING SECTION**

1. **HOW WEBSITES WORK**

Well we have a server hosted somewhere, and we, as a web browser want to get access to that server to
visualize a websites, what we are going to do as a client is use a network.

a network between ourselves and the server, and the client will find the network and will use network to
route the packets, the data into the server, then the server will reply to us, and we will get the
response, and we can view a website.

Now for the clients to find the server and the server to find the clients, you need to have IP addresses.

so a client have IP addresses and a server also have an IP address. And the idea is that when you use an
IP address, you can send a request to whatever you want to the server you want and the server can know
how to find you back.

2. **WHAT IS A SERVER COMPOSED OF?**

Well a server is going to contain a CPU:

- Compute: CPU = this CPU is a little piece what will be doing some computations, it will very helpful to do some calculations and find results.
- Memory: RAM = Your server also needs RAM, or Memory this is going to be very, very fast memory.
  which will allow us to store information and retreive it very quickly.

So when we have a CPU and a memory bar, what do we get?? we get a brain.

- Storage: Data = files, but if we want to store the data in a more structure way, we use a database.

-Database: Store data in structured way that we can easily serach it and query it.

Finally in the server, we're algo going to have some networking aspect, and that is going to be :

-Networks: Routers, switch, DNS server.

**IT Terminology**

1. **Network**: cables, routers and servers connected with each other.
2. **Router**: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where
   to send your packets on the internet.
3. **Switch**: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network.

**What is Cloud Computing?**

1. Is the on-demand of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources.
2. Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go princing.
3. You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need.
4. You can access as many resources as you need, almos instantly.
5. Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and set of application services.

6. Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

**The Deployment Models of the Cloud**

**Private Cloud**

1. Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
2. Complete control.
3. Security for sensitive applications.
4. Meet specific business needs.

**Public Cloud**

1. Cloud resources owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider delivered over the internet.
2. Six advantages of cloud Computing.

**Hybrid Cloud**

1. Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud.
2. Control over sensitive assets in you private infrastructure.
3. Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud.

**The five charactetistics of cloud computing**

1. **On-demand self service:**
   users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider.
2. **Broad network access:**
   Resources available over the network, and can be accesses by diverse client platforms.
3. **Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:**
   Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy .
   Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources.
4. **Rapid elasticity and scalability:**
   Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed.
   Quickly and easily scale based on demand.
5. **Measured service:**
   Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used.

**Six Advantages of Cloud Computing**

1. **Trade Capital Expense (CAPEX) For Opertional Expense (OPEX)**
   Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware.
   Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX).
2. **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
   Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale.
3. **Stop guessing capacity**
   Scale based on actual measured usage.
4. **Increase speed and agility**
5. **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
6. **Go global in minutes : Leverage the AWS global infrastructure**

**Problems solved by the cloud**

1. **Flexibility:** Change resource types when needed.
2. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay as you go, for what you use.
3. **Scalability:** Accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes.
4. **Elasticity:** Ability to scale out and scale-in when needed.
5. **High-availability and fault-tolerance:** Build across data centers.
6. **Agility:** Rapidly develop, test and launch software applications.

**Types of Cloud Computing**

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
   Provide building blocks for Cloud IT.
   Provides networking, computers, data storage space.
   Highest level of flexibility.
   Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
   Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure.
   Focus on the deployment and management of your applications.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
   Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.
