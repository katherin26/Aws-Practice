# **WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING SECTION**

1. **HOW WEBSITES WORK**

Well we have a server hosted somewhere, and we, as a web browser want to get access to that server to
visualize a websites, what we are going to do as a client is use a network.

a network between ourselves and the server, and the client will find the network and will use network to
route the packets, the data into the server, then the server will reply to us, and we will get the
response, and we can view a website.

Now for the clients to find the server and the server to find the clients, you need to have IP addresses.

so a client have IP addresses and a server also have an IP address. And the idea is that when you use an
IP address, you can send a request to whatever you want to the server you want and the server can know
how to find you back.
